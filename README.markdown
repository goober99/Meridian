## About Meridian

Easily create and edit timelines. Students can create timelines to help study. Teachers can use timelines as a visual aid. Writers can include timelines to visually depict a sequence of events or history of a subject.

## How to Run Meridian

## Technical Notes

Meridian is written in Scheme and targets the Racket Scheme implementation. Meridian is still in an embryonic state of development and should be considered pre-alpha software.

If you know (or would like to learn) Scheme and would like to help develop Meridian, you can contact the developer at matthewdmiller@swingthesickle.com.
